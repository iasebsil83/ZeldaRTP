# Language

Though informations for this project are available in english, this project is only available in french.

This file has been written this way for a better internationnalization of the project overview.

# Global Game information

Run ZeldaRTP.py to start the game.

Further precisions:

 - This is a beta, the command that controls the keyboard pauses the game so all is rythmed to these actions.

 - For the same reason as previously, it is then NORMAL that the display does not update itself everytime.
   (example: The sword only disapear at the next action)

 - In the keyboard settings menu, there is 2 keys in parenthesis : They are not customizable.

 - Keys for moving are "ZQSD" (classic azerty so not "WASD").

 - To save, press "o" and to access inventory press "i".

 - The 3 arms of the game are usable by default using "k","l" et "m" but are customisable.

# Boss fights

Here is the solution for beating all the bosses of the game so you might not want to see it except if you are stuck somewhere dying repeatly forever.
```
 - For the first boss, simply slash him with your sword.

 - For the second one, only bombs are efficient.

 - For the third one, only the hookshot.

 - For the final bass, there is a strategy :
       > First use hookshot => He is weakened
       > Then use a bomb => He is falling down
       > And finally, sweep ONE time with your sword => He is loosing 1 heart and standing up
```
